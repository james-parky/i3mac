//! Core Foundation
//!
//! Access low-level functions, primitive data types, and various collection
//! types that are bridged seamlessly with the Foundation framework.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Core Foundation is a framework that provides fundamental software services
//! useful to application services, application environments, and to
//! applications themselves. Core Foundation also provides abstractions for
//! common data types, facilitates internationalisation with Unicode string
//! storage, and offers a suite of utilities such as plug-in support, XML
//! property lists, URL resource access, and preferences.

/// `CFArray` and its derived mutable type, `CFMutableArrayRef`, manage ordered
/// collections of values called arrays. `CFArray` creates static arrays and
/// `CFMutableArray` creates dynamic arrays.
///
/// You create a static array object using either the `CFArrayCreate` or
/// `CFArrayCreateCopy` function. These functions return an array containing the
/// values you pass in as arguments. (Note that arrays can’t contain `NULL`
/// pointers; in most cases, though, you can use the `kCFNull` constant
/// instead). Values are not copied but retained using the retain callback
/// provided when an array was created. Similarly, when a value is removed from
/// an array, it is released using the release callback.
///
/// `CFArray`’s two primitive functions `CFArrayGetCount` and
/// `CFArrayGetValueAtIndex` provide the basis for all other functions in its
/// interface. The `CFArrayGetCount` function returns the number of elements in
/// an array; `CFArrayGetValueAtIndex` gives you access to an array’s elements
/// by index, with index values starting at 0.
///
/// A number of `CFArray` functions allow you to operate over a range of values
/// in an array, for example `CFArrayApplyFunction` lets you apply a function to
/// values in an array, and `CFArrayBSearchValues` searches an array for the
/// value that matches its parameter. Recall that a range is defined as
/// `{start, length}`, therefore to operate over the entire array the range you
/// supply should be `{0, N}` (where N is the count of the array).
///
/// `CFArray` is “toll-free bridged” with its Cocoa Foundation counterpart,
/// `NSArray`. This means that the `core_foundation` type is interchangeable in
/// function or method calls with the bridged Foundation object. Therefore, in a
/// method where you see an `NSArray*` parameter, you can pass in a
/// `CFArrayRef`, and in a function where you see a `CFArrayRef` parameter, you
/// can pass in an `NSArray` instance. This also applies to concrete subclasses
/// of `NSArray`. See Toll-Free Bridged Types for more information on toll-free
/// bridging.

/// A `CFRunLoopSource` object is an abstraction of an input source that can be
/// put into a run loop. Input sources typically generate asynchronous events,
/// such as messages arriving on a network port or actions performed by the
/// user.
///
/// An input source type normally defines an API for creating and operating on
/// objects of the type, as if it were a separate entity from the run loop, then
/// provides a function to create a `CFRunLoopSource` for an object. The run
/// loop source can then be registered with the run loop and act as an
/// intermediary between the run loop and the actual input source type object.
/// Examples of input sources include `CFMachPortRef`, `CFMessagePortRef`, and
/// `CFSocketRef`.
///
/// There are two categories of sources. Version 0 sources, so named because the
/// version field of their context structure is 0, are managed manually by the
/// application. When a source is ready to fire, some part of the application,
/// perhaps code on a separate thread waiting for an event, must call
/// `CFRunLoopSourceSignal` to tell the run loop that the source is ready to
/// fire. The run loop source for `CFSocket` is currently implemented as a
/// version 0 source.
///
/// Version 1 sources are managed by the run loop and kernel. These sources use
/// Mach ports to signal when the sources are ready to fire. A source is
/// automatically signaled by the kernel when a message arrives on the source’s
/// Mach port. The contents of the message are given to the source to process
/// when the source is fired. The run loop sources for `CFMachPort` and
/// `CFMessagePort` are currently implemented as version 1 sources.
///
/// When creating your own custom run loop source, you can choose which version
/// works best for you.
///
/// A run loop source can be registered in multiple run loops and run loop modes
/// at the same time. When the source is signaled, whichever run loop that
/// happens to detect the signal first will fire the source. Adding a source to
/// multiple threads’ run loops can be used to manage a pool of “worker” threads
/// that is processing discrete sets of data, such as client-server messages
/// over a network or entries in a job queue filled by a “manager” thread. As
/// messages arrive or jobs get added to the queue, the source gets signaled and
/// a random thread receives and processes the request.

/// `CFString` provides a suite of efficient string-manipulation and

/// manage a string that can be changed after it has been created.
///
/// `CFString` has two primitive functions, `CFStringGetLength` and
/// `CFStringGetCharacterAtIndex`, that provide the basis for all other
/// functions in its interface. The `CFStringGetLength` function returns the
/// total number (in terms of UTF-16 code pairs) of characters in the string.
/// The `CFStringGetCharacterAtIndex` function gives access to each character
/// in the string by index, with index values starting at 0.
///
/// `CFString` provides functions for finding and comparing strings. It also
/// provides functions for reading numeric values from strings, for combining
/// strings in various ways, and for converting a string to different forms
/// (such as encoding and case changes). A number of functions, for example
/// `CFStringFindWithOptions`, allow you to specify a range over which to
/// operate within a string. The specified range must not exceed the length of
/// the string. Debugging options may help you to catch any errors that arise if
/// a range does exceed a string’s length.
///
/// Like other `core_foundation` types, you can hash `CFString`s using the
/// `CFHash` function. You should never, though, store a hash value outside of
